# Ethernet-Siemens-5G
## Milestone 1
### Generate and write 4-byte aligned Ethernet packets to a file based on configurations, ensuring periodic bursts until the specified streaming time ends, with interframe gaps (IFGs) for alignment.
## Milestone 2
### Embed eCPRI payloads containing ORAN user-plane IQ samples in Ethernet packets, reusing input IQ data cyclically if needed, and conform to ORAN standards.
